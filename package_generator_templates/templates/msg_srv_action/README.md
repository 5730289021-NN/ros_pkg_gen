# msg_srv_action

Template of a package that would contain message, action or service definition.
No code, just interface definition.

In the interface, the developer is asked to provide for any of these interface a name and a description.

The template will not create the message/service/action file.
It only prepares the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml file for the Developer.
